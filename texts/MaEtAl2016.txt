1.1 Background.
Citation count between scientific publications have
been the primary metric to measure importance and
impact of articles or authors for decades. The advantage is simplicity and effectiveness. However,
with the progress of machine learning, NLP and
other disciplines, researchers developed various
techniques to improve the quality of citation analysis and hence the quality of scholarly importance
measurement. One of the efforts was to apply PageRank in citation network, which introduces weight
on citation links for more accurate measurement
(Ding, 2011). Although, this type of weighting is
widely criticized (Alvarez and Soriano, 2014). Recent bibliometric studies showed that "there is no
bad publicity in science", because criticized and
controversial papers tend to be highly cited too (Radicch, 2012; Perc, 2014). Consequently, these controversial papers are positively estimated according
to citation-count-based metrics, for example, impact
factor and h-index. As Bonzi (1982) argued that if a
cited work is criticized, it should consequently carry
lower or even negative weight for bibliometric
measures (Athar and Teufel, 2011).
1.2 Our contribution.
Sentiment analysis of citation sentence makes this
kind of fine-grained bibliometric measures possible.
Augmented with polarized citation links, the citation network can be weighted more accurately by
using negative weights. We introduce the p-index,
which is the h-index extended by citation polarities.
Our assumption is that papers from prominent researchers are more probable to be cited in a positive
manner than the papers from controversial researchers. Generally, if we know more about a researcher,
it should be easier to determine the polarity of citations his/her paper receives. Our research question
is whether or not the performance of citation sentiment analysis can be improved with better author
modelling, in particular modeling with citation polarity.
In this paper, we report our on-going work on the
citation sentiment analysis task. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: the next section briefly
reviews some important work in this field. Then we
introduce our method. In section 4, we present our
experiment details. Preliminary experiment results
and discussions about the results are structured in
section 5 and 6. Finally, we summarize our work
and discuss possible directions of future work.
